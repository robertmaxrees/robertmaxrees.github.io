Another status meeting, another day.  You're being told that a feature needs to be shipped in the next three weeks, but you know it won't happen.  You've been on this project for 3 months now and the stakeholders are getting itchy.  The DBAs got pulled into another critical issue last month, which set your team back a few weeks.  Making matters worse, an audit and a regulatory change both swept through, taking up valuable time from your team.  You get out of this meeting, check your email, and are greeted with a notification that the higher ups have decided you're going to be shifting to a new OAuth provider.  Contract for the current one is up in 6 weeks.

Great.

These kinds of scenarios happen all to often and signal major failings in planning, capacity management, resourcing, and plain common sense.  There's no magical silver bullet for each of these, but there are strategies your org can deploy to help ease the pressure.  Of the available options, the Product Operating Model is one of my favorites.

## Technology Organizations Are A Clearing House For Company Strategy

As a company grows, the more internal interests are at play.  These interests aren't necessarily in competition with one another on the outset.  Senior management will greenlight the resultant strategies as "good" and "a priority".  As these strategies grow and develop, they do so in silos.  This becomes a major problem, because suddenly you need *people* to do the *work*.  And we need to know *when* these *people* will *deliver* this *work* so I can tell my leadership chain when my thing will be live and when they can expect me to start next steps on it.

Now add in 5 or 6 other strategies doing the same thing.  And they all need some level of involvement by a shared resource, like your software engineers.  The issues become very apparent very quickly:
- Timelines are decided *before* engineers get a chance to even validate that something can even be done, let alone a delivery date
- Engineers are juggling priorities from other teams
- Engineers also have regular work to keep the lights on
- Incidents happen, and the people who often fix critical issues are also the people who work on these other projects
- Once the path is decided, there's rarely any flexibility in what the final product can be - there may be a simpler, much quicker solution available, but you'll never know
- At it's worst, the org turns into a burnout factory, as engineers are made to work long hours and weekends to deliver what they've been committed to

Instead, we need to re-think where ideas come from, how they're executed, who's accountable for what, and focus on improved overall planning that's more holistic in practice.
