# My Code Blog.

## Premise

This may or may not become my primary blogging environment.  For now, it's a code blog.  It's about, well, code.  Mostly JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.  All opinions here are solely my own and do not reflect those of my employer, spouse, parents, cat, or beer.

Though beer *is* tasty...
