title: jQuery and Community - Some Thoughts
---

I've been spending a lot of time lately thinking about the role of community in programming and technology related projects.  It's a very powerful thing, and when we look at high profile projects like jQuery, we realize that these communities can have tremendous power and influence - so much so that it can actually help shape things on a global level.  These communities can come up with amazing ideas and empower actual human beings to do very important, meaningful, impactful things.

This idyllic landscape, however, can quickly become a field polluted with landmines.  The internet is a bit of a free for all, and as a result you still frequently see people looking for cheap laughs or who seemingly fuel themselves on arguments.  We cannot control these people, and things like irreverence and disagreement can be very healthy.  But eventually it becomes necessary to lay a foundation for the discussion to take place in.

As the primary author of the [Code of Conduct](http://irc.jquery.org/irc-help/#code-of-conduct) for the all of the [jQuery](http://jquery.org) channels on [freenode](http://freenode.net), I thought it might be interesting to cover some of the process I went through.  Writing a code of conduct is hard.  Like, real hard.  You have to consider the environment you want to foster while not discouraging organic growth.  You want to keep things civil, but not rule with an iron fist.  You ultimately want the community to run itself, instead of having to manage it.
